Project Proposal:

Social Music App (Main Project Idea):
	Our idea is to create a social community centered around music. We will do this through two main features: displaying the user’s most played songs for the week, and which users relate to your music tastes the most. This is to have people know what music others are listening to and who you would be able to talk to about your own music tastes. This will be done using Spotify’s API, in which we will scalp user’s data on which song they listen to the most, the genres, and whatever other data points are available.

Gift Recommendation App:
	Our idea is to create an app that helps friends and family buy gifts for loved ones. This eliminates the question that always pops up when buying gifts for someone: “What would they like?”. We would get the data through Facebook and look at the interests that the person hits like on. From here, we would generate a list of gift ideas to present to the buyer.

Cheapest Items on Facebook App:
	Our idea is to help users locate the cheapest items on the Facebook marketplace and through groups (like Free and For Sale). We would build off of previous items that are similar or exactly the same and display to the users at what price point that specific item was sold before. This way, users know if they are getting the best price at the time or close to it.

Clothes Matching App:
	Our idea is to make matching clothes easier. Users tend to buy one piece of clothing online, but not the other piece (ie shorts but not with a shirt). We would gather fashion trends and base recommendations on what users should buy with their piece of clothing. We would keep suggesting recommendations until the user is satisfied with how the combination looks.
