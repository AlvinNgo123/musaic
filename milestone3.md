<p>Below are the screenshots for our UI skeleton pages. Despite for the styling that was present in our paper prototype, the major functionality is still the same, specifically being able to search for a specific person and getting an immediate update on what their favorite/featured song is. In addition, we've implemented the basic layout of how we want to present the information in the profile pages which is nearly the same as the paper prototypes. Currently, we haven't implemented our post/update feature in our homepage yet because we want to make sure that we can first successfully utilize Spotify's API in order to get all nececessary information from our user before we add more features. Other than that, we have to chosen to stick with the two main functionality features of searching for your friend's updates/profiles and updating/featuring your stop song.</p></br>
