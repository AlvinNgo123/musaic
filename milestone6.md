<h1>Explanation of how UI improved</h1></br>
In terms of UI changes, we just focused on adding a more clean and uniform look to our different pages by going through and fixing the overlaying text issue that we had before with words overflowing pas their boundaries due to word length. However, we now actually went and blocked out each boundary so any words that were too long could be shortened. Then, we also finalized how our search for a song feature page would look like by having it blend more with the other pages so there was a sense of uniformity that wasn't present before.

<h1>Explanation Data Visualization</h1></br> 
For our data visualization, we used the Spotify API to first grab the user's name, profile picture, top song, and the artist who sings that top song. From there, we made a user box in our home feed page that summarized all 4 of these basic info so that users can easily glimpse at each friend's top song and artist on their homepage without going straight into the actual profile of that friend.
