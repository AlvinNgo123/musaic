<h1>Explanation of how UI improved</h1></br>
In terms of UI changes, we focused on refining small details that would help improve our user interface. For our Login page, button has now been changed to only logging in with Spotify, making user flow easier with only one option. Then for main page, we made an Ajax call to the database which now loads every profile. It will also update for every new user put into the database. In addition, we made altercations to the color scheme to make each feature stand out more.
