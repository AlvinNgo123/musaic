<h1>Explanation of how UI improved</h1></br>
In terms of UI changes, we focused on refining small details that would help improve our user interface. For our Login page, button has now been changed to only logging in with Spotify, making user flow easier with only one option. Then for main page, we made an Ajax call to the database which now loads every profile. It will also update for every new user put into the database. In addition, we made altercations to the color scheme to make each feature stand out more.

<h1>Activity 1</h1></br>
When the user logs in with their spotify profile, it will take the user's information and create a profile page for them.  This will automatically be populated with user information including a profile picture, favorite artists, favorite songs, recently played music, and more.  This will be done upon user sign in, and you can access your profile by clicking on "Your Profile" in the hamburger menu.

<h1>Activity 2</h1></br>
On the home screen, the goal is to set your favorite song so that other people will be able to see what is your current jam. To do this, click on the button named "Set Favorite Song". From there, you can search up a song name. Click on the song name and set it as your favorite song. Your feed on the home page should now reflect what song you selected.
