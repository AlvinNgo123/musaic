<h1>Explanation of how UI improved</h1></br>
In terms of UI changes, we focused on refining small details that would help improve our user interface. For our Login page, button has now been changed to only logging in with Spotify, making user flow easier with only one option. Then for main page, we made an Ajax call to the database which now loads every profile. It will also update for every new user put into the database. In addition, we made altercations to the color scheme to make each feature stand out more.

<h1>Activity 1</h1></br>
First goal is to successfully login into Musaic by logging in and authorizing your spotify information to be passed to Musaic. Upon successful authorization, you will be redirected to the home page/feed where you will see your basic mini profile/info along with the other users in the Musaic community. You know that your friends "Alvin Ngo" and "Nathan Mansur" are both on the Musaic app as well so go ahead and quickly search for their mini profile by typing their name into the search bar and pressing search.

<h1>Activity 2</h1></br>
On the home screen, the goal is to search for a song that your friend recommended to you and play a snippet to see if you actually like it. To do this, click on the button named "Search For A Song". From there, go ahead and search for "Viva La Vida" (or a popular song of your choice) to listen to a snippet of it.
