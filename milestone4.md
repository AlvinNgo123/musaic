<h1>Explanation of how UI improved</h1></br>
In terms of UI improvements, we chose to focus specifically on our home page/feed and our profile page. For our last milestone, it was all about kind of just outlining where we thought the elements would roughly be located. Therefore, for this milestone, we chose to add in all the final details to those pages as well as implement any additional designs that we felt made the page more mobile friendly and left room to implement additional features if the time permits. For example, we initially only had text stating information such as the user’s favorite songs and artists, but in our redesign we made this more visually appealing by providing images and transitions throughout the interface. In addition, we can see that the pages are now starting to look more and more like how we had visualized the app interface in our paper prototypes. </br>


<h1>Our Approach to Privacy</h1></br>
Since we’re using Spotify’s API in our project to obtain our user’s information such as name, email, Spotify URL, and profile, we want to make sure that the user realizes that these are the confidential items that they will be giving us access to when they login to our Musaic application. Therefore, one of our ideas was to create a popup that would list all the info that our application would getting form the users and have the popup come up when the user is first trying to register an account. This would address the privacy issue because the users will know exactly what personal information will be shared and they can opt out if they desire.
